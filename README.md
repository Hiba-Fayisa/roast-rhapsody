### Project Description
"Roast Me" is a playful web app that takes your name (or any text) and instantly serves you a savage, witty roast‚Äîjust for fun! It‚Äôs the perfect way to get roasted by a machine that has no mercy and even less chill."

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People aren‚Äôt getting roasted enough in their daily lives. Compliments are overrated‚Äîsometimes, you just need to be hilariously humbled.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A one-click roast generator that delivers handcrafted insults in milliseconds. Just type your name, click a button, and prepare to be humbled.
